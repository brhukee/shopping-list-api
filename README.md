Project Planning.
I wanted to make a shopping list that allowed you to create a list, edit a list,
or delete a list while being signed into your account. Express is handling all
of the data coming in and I have used Mongoose to store that data that is being
sent.

Technologies I used.
Express
Mongoose
MongoDB
